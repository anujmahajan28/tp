Hi Ashish,
I had a call yesterday with Jaya regarding the Playwright flows and process.
I’ve already gone through the workflows and explored the features, including how tokens are passed.
I had asked Jaya to practice the flows, but I couldn’t directly access the app myself.
So, I explored it on my own, and today he has scheduled a call for a KT session on the flows and how the test cases actually work in Playwright.
