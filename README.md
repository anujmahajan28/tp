Subject: Status of Intern ISPL is Marked as “No Show”

Dear [Recipient’s Name/HR Team],

Good morning.

I noticed that the status for my Intern ISPL attendance is marked as “No Show.” However, I had attended the session in offline mode, so I’m unsure why this is reflecting incorrectly.

Kindly request you to review and update the attendance status accordingly. Please let me know if any further details are required from my end.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Anuj Mahajan
Intern – BNP Paribas ISPL
