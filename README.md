Subject: Request for Guidance – Intern ISPL Session Marked as “No Show”

Dear [Recipient’s Name/HR Team],

Good morning.

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention that my attendance status for the Intern ISPL session has been marked as “No Show.” I was unable to attend the session as I was on approved leave due to university examinations on that day.

I kindly request your guidance on whether there is any provision available to complete the missed session. Additionally, if a recording of the session is available, I would be grateful if you could share it with me.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if any further information is required from my end.

Warm regards,
Anuj Mahajan
Intern – BNP Paribas ISPL
