 Week 1: May 1â€“4 (Partial Week)
Initiated familiarization with the Credit Chain module, understanding its purpose in the credit approval lifecycle.

Accessed and reviewed the MCA Release Functional Scope and Readiness dashboard, which includes critical Jira tickets related to various modules.

Started exploring the UAT environment, where I performed initial end-to-end testing â€” beginning from request creation to reaching the decision phase, helping me grasp the complete business flow.

Learned to navigate various environments (Dev, QA, UAT) and accessed links related to each.

Began understanding Jira statuses (e.g., To Do, In Progress, QA, Ready for UAT, Closed, etc.) and how to trace a feature or bug through its lifecycle.

âœ… Week 2: May 5â€“11
Deep-dived into the Workflow module in MyCreditApp (MCA), referring to key documents like:

Workflow User Guide, which helped in understanding how requests are routed.

Operational Guidelines explaining conditions, transitions, and approver hierarchy.

Workflow Tips offering insights into common blockers and resolutions.

Use Case Documentation with real-world flow simulations and expected outcomes.

Explored associated platforms such as:

SharePoint (Sharaform) for internal forms and resources.

Credit App Academy for micro-learning videos and guides.

FAQs and Glossary to clarify project-specific terminology.

Practiced UAT request creation, error validation, and observing changes through status transitions (Request Raised â†’ In Review â†’ Decision Made).

Attended a Knowledge Transfer (KT) session on:

Request creation steps.

Contract creation flow and business rules associated with various contract types.

Understood how contract data is tied to credit applications and downstream systems.

Explored more Jira tickets to understand story cards vs. bug tickets and how releases are tracked.

Practiced writing and modifying basic SQL queries for record lookup, understanding data structures, and validating database-driven workflows.

Started installing Playwright for automation, but faced some issues related to compatibility and setup.

ðŸ›‘ Week 3: May 12â€“18
Was on leave from May 15 to May 21 due to university semester exams.

Up to May 14:

Continued request creation on UAT and analyzed request behavior on the QA environment.

Attempted further setup of Playwright but was blocked due to unresolved installation issues.

Left progress checkpoints in the tracker to ensure resumption post-leave would be smoother.

âœ… Week 4: May 22â€“25
Resumed post-leave by revisiting previously covered modules and syncing up with team updates.

Started test execution again on UAT and China environments, repeating workflows to build muscle memory and avoid functional confusion.

Conducted end-to-end testing from request initiation, through approver chain, to the final decision and completion.

Faced issues again with Playwright installation (Node compatibility, missing dependencies).

Discussed and troubleshooted with Alok, identified setup gaps were missed due to time constraints the previous day.

Understood the need for environmental readiness and tool compatibility before automation scripting.

âœ… Week 5: May 26â€“31
Successfully resolved the Playwright setup issues and initiated the implementation of sample test scripts.

Continued test executions on UAT, focusing on edge cases and error handling.

Attempted new request creations, although faced UAT environment downtime, which blocked some steps.

Explored remaining Jira statuses such as QA Rejected, UAT Passed, UAT Failed, On Hold, and their impact on ticket flow.

Practiced writing SQL queries for filtering data, joining tables for consolidated views, and sorting for output validation.

Documented SQL learning in a personal tracker, recording example queries, use cases, and observations for future reference.

Updated my practice sheet to include modules covered, challenges faced, KT learnings, and tools explored.

Maintained consistency in workflow rehearsals, focusing on building accuracy and reducing manual errors.
