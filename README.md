We can introduce “PeerSync”, a recurring knowledge-sharing and collaboration session designed to help new joiners integrate smoothly while encouraging cross-team interaction. In each session, team members can share project insights, tools, or quick learnings in a casual, engaging format. This will foster a culture of continuous learning, open communication, and peer-driven growth within the cluster.
