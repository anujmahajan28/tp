Subject: Update on Test Case Slicing and Current Challenges

Hi Ashish,

I wanted to share a quick update regarding the test case slicing activity and the challenges I‚Äôm currently facing:
	‚Ä¢	While working on the test case slicing, I observed that there are additional possible scenarios that need to be covered to ensure complete analysis.
	‚Ä¢	I am rechecking the entire flow to confirm that all cases, including availability and mandatory fields, are properly captured.
	‚Ä¢	For better clarity, I‚Äôm also adding tables in the description section to give a detailed view of each page, which helps in easy understanding and verification.
	‚Ä¢	The test cases were returned to me mainly because a few business rules and variations were not fully aligned or clearly defined in the Gherkins.
	‚Ä¢	I am now aligning all scenarios with the business rules and ensuring the Gherkins are written properly.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm continuously taking reviews and suggestions from Taher, who is helping me identify missing parts and improve the structure.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm focusing on being more accurate, positive, and detail-oriented while implementing these changes to make the test cases comprehensive and clear.

Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything specific you‚Äôd like me to focus more on.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Ashish, good morning.
i have not been feeling well for the past few days due to viral, so I have a doctor‚Äôs appointment around 10:30 AM today.
Is it okay if I step out for a while and log back in by 11:15 AM?

‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§É ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡•Ç‡§≤‡§ó‡§Æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§¨‡•ç‡§ß‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç!‚Äù
(Even time has started moving in the opposite direction!

Yesterday, I worked further on the design part and shared some cases with Taher for review. I also reviewed the folder and worked on the NRT part in both UAT and China environments. Today, I‚Äôll continue with the same tasks and review any feedback or changes that come up.

This video, "JavaScript Functions Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, is 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 54 seconds long. It covers a comprehensive range of JavaScript function topics, from fundamentals to advanced concepts like closures and recursion.
Here's a suggested plan to finish the video in 2 days:
Day 1: Fundamentals and Core Concepts (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch up to the section on Arrow Functions/Nested Functions/Function Scope. This would cover:
   * Introduction and course overview [00:00:00 - 00:03:17]
   * Fundamentals of JavaScript functions [03:17]
   * Clarifying terminologies (functions vs. methods, parameters vs. arguments) [03:30]
   * Function declarations and executions [03:48]
   * Call stack [03:55]
   * Arrow functions [03:55]
   * Nested functions and function scope [03:55]
 * Review and Practice: After watching, take some time to review the concepts and try out the code examples on your own.
Day 2: Advanced Concepts and Application (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch the remainder of the video, starting from Closures. This would cover:
   * Closures [03:59]
   * Callback functions and higher-order functions [03:59]
   * Pure functions [04:03]
   * Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) [04:03]
   * Recursion [04:08]
 * Review and Practice: Again, review the concepts and practice implementing them in your own code.
Stand-up Call Details for the Next 2 Days:
Here's a template for your daily stand-up calls, focusing on your progress with the video:
Day 1 Stand-up (e.g., Friday morning):
 * What I did yesterday (or plan to do today): "Today, I plan to watch the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, focusing on the fundamentals, function declarations, and arrow functions. I'll also spend time practicing the code examples."
 * What I'll do today (if applicable, for a morning stand-up): (Same as above, or if you already started, describe what you've completed.)
 * What I'll do tomorrow (for an evening stand-up): "Tomorrow, I'll continue with the second half of the video, covering closures, callbacks, and recursion, and then dedicate time to practice."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers currently, but I'll reach out if I get stuck on any of the concepts."
Day 2 Stand-up (e.g., Saturday morning):
 * What I did yesterday: "Yesterday, I completed watching the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, covering up to arrow functions and function scope. I also practiced some of the basic function examples."
 * What I'll do today: "Today, I will finish the video by watching the sections on closures, callback functions, pure functions, IIFE, and recursion. My goal is to understand these advanced concepts and then practice implementing them."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers at the moment. I'll focus on understanding the more complex topics today."
Remember to adjust the details based on your actual progress and any challenges you encounter.

Today, I watched the remaining part of the JavaScript video, starting from Closures. It covered closures, callback functions, higher-order functions, pure functions, IIFEs, and recursion. I also continued working on the NRT cases and have almost completed them.
=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(D2), ISNUMBER(E2)), E2 - D2, "")

I‚Äôve started with the basics‚Äîfocusing on core recommended locators like getByRole, getByText, and getByLabel. I‚Äôm also learning how Playwright handles dynamic elements with auto-wait and retry logic. I‚Äôve planned to finish this documentation in 2 days, with hands-on practice to better understand their usage.

üêû Bug Title

[GREENLIGHT] [Auto Approval] Greenlight not auto-approved after reaching auto approval date when Informal

‚∏ª

üìù Description

In a Greenlight request where the Greenlight status is Submitted and marked as Informal, once the configured auto-approval date is reached, the system does not auto-approve the Greenlight as expected. This causes the workflow to remain stuck at the submitted stage.

‚∏ª

üîÅ Steps to Reproduce
	1.	Create a Greenlight Request and fill in required details.
	2.	Ensure the Greenlight status is set to Submitted.
	3.	Set the Greenlight Formal/Informal field to Informal.
	4.	Wait until the auto-approval date is reached.
	5.	Check the status of the Greenlight.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Expected Result

Once the auto-approval date is reached, the Greenlight should automatically transition to Approved, especially for Informal requests.

‚∏ª

‚ùå Actual Result

The Greenlight remains in Submitted status, and does not get auto-approved, even after the auto-approval date is reached.


Also verified if the cases are properly aligned with the test case design rules, and planned updates if any further changes are needed.

Final Presentation Script (Present Tense, with Sanity Testing)

(Start ‚Äì 30‚Äì40 sec)
‚ÄúLet me walk you through my project experience on MyCreditApp ‚Äì the Request Module at BNP Paribas.
This module is used globally to create, structure, and decide on corporate credit requests.
It involves multiple user roles ‚Äî
the Credit Analyst, who creates and structures the request;
the Relationship Manager, who validates compliance;
the Senior Credit Officer or Delegation Holder, who takes the final credit decision;
and the Middle Office (CTM), which updates all approved data in downstream systems like contracts and records.
In short, it‚Äôs the digital workflow for corporate credit approvals.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Testing Strategy ‚Äì ~1 min)
‚ÄúOur main goal in testing this module is to make the process faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain.
Initially, most tests are manual, which makes each release cycle lengthy and repetitive.
So our current testing strategy focuses on five key areas:
	1.	Optimizing manual test cases ‚Äì by removing duplicates and rewriting steps for better clarity.
	2.	Executing Sanity and NRT tests ‚Äì Sanity Testing helps verify that major functions work after every deployment, while NRT or Non-Regression Testing ensures older features still perform correctly after new changes.
	3.	Integrating Playwright automation ‚Äì Playwright is a web automation framework that simulates real user actions on browsers to speed up repetitive testing.
	4.	Streamlining documentation ‚Äì keeping all workflows, test cases, and reports organized and updated.
	5.	Tracking everything via Jira and Excel ‚Äì Jira helps log defects, assign tasks, and track sprint progress, while Excel is used for execution summaries and defect analysis.

The purpose of this strategy is to improve accuracy, reduce testing time, and make our releases more predictable.‚Äù

(Understanding the Requirement ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúMy first contribution was studying how the credit workflow operates end-to-end.
I analyzed how each user role interacts with the system and what business logic lies behind every screen.
This helped ensure that the test scenarios I worked on aligned with the real business flow, not just the UI.
Understanding this context early on helped us identify what truly needed validation during testing.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Test Scenario Design ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúNext came Test Scenario Design.
I helped create modular, well-structured test cases for request creation and approval.
A modular approach means each test focuses on a single function, so it‚Äôs easier to reuse and maintain.
We also worked on optimizing existing cases to remove redundancies.
This directly improved the speed and clarity of our Non-Regression Testing cycles.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Automation Exposure ‚Äì 50 sec)
‚ÄúI also got exposure to Automation using Playwright along with Gherkin syntax.
Gherkin is a language used in Behavior-Driven Development; it describes test scenarios in plain English using the ‚ÄòGiven‚ÄìWhen‚ÄìThen‚Äô format.
For example:
‚ÄòGiven the user is on the Request Dashboard, When they submit details, Then the request is created.‚Äô
Even though I wasn‚Äôt directly coding the scripts, understanding how Playwright executes these Gherkin scenarios gave me a strong foundation for future automation work.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(NRT Execution & Reporting ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúI was also responsible for executing Non-Regression Tests after each release.
We validated that all previously working features still behaved as expected.
Any issues found were logged in Jira, assigned to developers, and tracked until resolution.
Finally, I summarized all execution results, coverage, and defects in Excel reports for our testing dashboard.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Challenges & Solutions ‚Äì 50 sec)
‚ÄúOne of our key challenges was managing a very large set of manual test cases, many of which were outdated or overlapping.
Another was incomplete documentation that made onboarding and reporting slower.
To solve this, I helped reorganize the test repository, updated steps to match the current build, and added proper traceability in Jira.
We also identified which test cases were suitable for future automation using Playwright ‚Äî laying a foundation for faster testing cycles.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Learnings & Impact ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúThis project helped me develop a clear understanding of the entire QA lifecycle ‚Äî from requirement analysis and test design to execution and reporting.
I strengthened my skills in SQL for backend validation, Python for scripting logic, and Excel for test analysis.
I also learned how to think critically about test efficiency and business impact rather than just pass/fail results.
Overall, my work helped improve testing accuracy, documentation quality, and readiness for automation in upcoming releases.‚Äù


Impact on the Project:
Through my involvement in the Request module testing, I helped streamline manual test execution and improve the structure of test scenarios, making them more reusable and easier to maintain.
By ensuring consistent sanity and NRT coverage for every release, I contributed to better release stability and early defect detection.
My documentation updates and tracking via Jira and Excel helped bring more transparency to the testing cycle.
Overall, my contribution supported a smoother test process, reduced effort duplication, and strengthened the foundation for future automation integration.
‚∏ª

(Closing ‚Äì 20 sec)
‚ÄúIn summary, my time on the MyCreditApp Request Module gave me hands-on experience in real-world QA processes, exposure to automation tools, and a deeper understanding of how quality assurance drives reliability in financial systems.‚Äù

Good afternoon everyone, My name is Anuj Mahajan working as an Analyst at GBIT Corporate credits in MCA project.
I‚Äôll be sharing my experience and contribution to the Request Module of MyCreditApp.

This module is one of the key parts of the application. It provides all the functionalities required to create, structure, and decide a corporate credit request with user roles to ensure each credit request moves through the right review and approval stages.

When I started working on this project, my first step was to understand the entire credit workflow ‚Äî from how a request is initiated, reviewed, validated, and finally approved.
This stage is important because it helped me see how data flows across roles and what checkpoints are crucial for validation. Once I had that clarity, I began translating these functional steps into test scenarios that covered both business logic and user interactions.

The next step is test case design.
Here, my focus is on creating modular and reusable test cases that could be easily maintained and scaled for future releases.
Each test case is written using Gherkin syntax ‚Äî Given, When, Then ‚Äî which helped maintain a clear, behavior-driven format. This structure not only improved readability for manual testers but also ensured our test cases are written in a way that could directly support automation later.

Even I made sure that the cases are aligned with Playwright automation standards. For example, I included selector references, action sequences, and expected outcomes in a way that could be easily converted into Playwright steps by the automation team and saved their time during automation.

Once the design is in place, I worked on optimizing existing manual test cases.
Many scenarios were repetitive or overlapping, so I streamlined them, removed duplication, and merged related cases where possible. This improved test coverage while keeping the documentation lean and effective.

During every sprint and release, I am actively involve in executing Non-Regression Tests and Sanity checks.
Each cycle involved validating critical functionalities, logging defects in JIRA, and maintaining detailed reports in Excel for analysis and traceability.
These reports helped the team identify recurring issues and track how fixes were performing across builds.

Alongside this, I also contributed to streamlining the documentation process.
We structured the repository in a way that anyone new joining the project could quickly understand the test flow, business logic, and execution order.
This made our testing process faster and more consistent, especially during tight release timelines.

One thing I particularly enjoyed was how closely this work connected testing with business understanding. Every test scenario reflected an actual use case from the credit lifecycle. It wasn‚Äôt just about clicking through screens ‚Äî it was about ensuring that every approval, validation, and decision aligned with business rules and data accuracy.

Through this project, I got to strengthen both my technical and analytical skills.
Technically, I worked with tools like Python, SQL, JavaScript, JIRA, and Excel, and learned how they fit into the QA workflow.
Analytically, I learned how to think beyond pass/fail ‚Äî to look at why an issue happens, how it affects downstream processes, and how to prevent it in the future.

Working on this module also taught me the value of collaboration. I regularly interacted with developers, automation testers, and product owners to clarify requirements and align priorities. These discussions helped improve our understanding of dependencies and reduced turnaround time during defect resolution.The experience really helped me grow as a tester.


And I feel the sense of ownership and helped me contribute meaningfully to improving the quality and reliability of MyCreditApp‚Äôs credit request process. More importantly, it taught me how thoughtful planning and teamwork can make testing not just a checkpoint, but a reliable part of the delivery process.

Thank you.

We have one person who also has similar experience, so I would like to hand it over to Vishakha to take it further.


Hello everyone,
My name is Anuj Mahajan, and I am working as a Test Analyst at Banking Platform IT Corporate Credits for the MyCreditApp application. I‚Äôll be sharing my experience and contribution to the Request Module of MyCreditApp.

The purpose of the ‚ÄúRequest to Decision‚Äù module is to retrieve all the requests that have been created or validated for all coverage and business lines originating sites. It covers end-to-end workflow from request creation to decisions from a credit committee. The legal entities and facilities will have their own data journey with data coming from referential (current), input by the analysts (proposed), and input by decision makers (recommended / decided). And the decided data will be fed to other systems after final decision.

Working on this module also taught me the value of collaboration. I regularly interacted with developers, automation testers, and product owners to clarify requirements and align priorities. These discussions helped improve our understanding of dependencies and reduced turnaround time during defect resolution. The experience really helped me grow as a tester.

And I feel the sense of ownership and helped me contribute meaningfully to improving the quality and reliability of MyCreditApp‚Äôs credit request process. More importantly, it taught me how thoughtful planning and teamwork can make testing not just a checkpoint, but a reliable part of the delivery process.

Thank you.
We have one person who also has a similar experience, so I would like to hand it over to Vishakha to take it further.


1. CONTRACT MODULE

The Contract module represents the legally binding agreement created after a credit request is approved. It defines the relationship between the bank and the borrower, along with all financial and legal terms of the loan or credit facility.

Each contract starts from a validated Request and captures the essential details required before execution.

Key Terms and Meanings:
	‚Ä¢	Contract ID: A unique identifier automatically generated by the system. It helps track and reference the contract across different applications and audit trails.
	‚Ä¢	Contract Type: Defines what kind of agreement it is ‚Äî for example, a Loan Agreement, Credit Facility Agreement, or Guarantee Agreement.
	‚Ä¢	Contract Name: The title used to identify the contract (for example, ‚ÄúABC Ltd Term Loan Agreement‚Äù). This is shown throughout the system for easy reference.
	‚Ä¢	Governing Law: Indicates under which country‚Äôs or state‚Äôs legal system the contract is enforceable.
	‚Ä¢	Jurisdiction: Specifies where any legal disputes will be handled.
	‚Ä¢	Originating Site: The site or business line where the initial credit request originated. This helps in tracking cross-border or regional transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Implementing Site: The entity or branch responsible for executing and maintaining the contract once approved.
	‚Ä¢	Linked Request: Connects the contract to the original approved credit request. This ensures only validated transactions are converted into contracts.
	‚Ä¢	Borrower / Co-Borrower: The legal entities who are taking the loan or credit facility. These names appear in all related documentation.
	‚Ä¢	Facility: Represents the specific loan, credit line, or exposure created under the contract. Each facility has its own amount, tenor, and repayment terms.
	‚Ä¢	Execution Date: The date when the contract becomes legally binding. It marks the start of the contractual obligations.
	‚Ä¢	Contract Status: Indicates the progress of the contract, such as Draft, Under Validation, or Executed.
	‚Ä¢	Summary Tab: Provides a consolidated view of all linked facilities, documents, and covenants before final validation.

Purpose and Use:

The Contract module serves as the foundation of the deal. It transforms a credit request into a legally valid agreement. It also connects downstream modules such as Legal Documents and Covenants, ensuring that all contractual, legal, and compliance requirements are linked in one place.

In the MyCreditApp system, users typically verify key information, link the approved request, and check whether all legal documents and covenants are attached before executing the contract.

2. LEGAL DOCUMENT MODULE

The Legal Document module captures, monitors, and validates all legal paperwork associated with a contract or facility. It ensures that the bank holds all necessary documents required to make the credit legally enforceable.

Key Terms and Meanings:
	‚Ä¢	Legal Document Checklist: A list of all documents that must be received and validated for the contract (e.g., Termsheet, Credit Agreement, Guarantee Documents).
	‚Ä¢	Document Type: Defines the category of the document such as Credit Agreement, Facility Letter, Guarantee, or Pledge Agreement.
	‚Ä¢	Expected Date: The target date when the document is expected to be received.
	‚Ä¢	Received Date: The actual date on which the document was received.
	‚Ä¢	Reception Status: Shows whether the document has been received, is pending, or is under validation.
	‚Ä¢	Need Hardcopy: Indicates if a physical signed copy of the document is required, as some documents must be physically stored for legal compliance.
	‚Ä¢	Safekeeping Status: Shows whether the document has been securely stored (physically or digitally) in the safekeeping vault or document repository.
	‚Ä¢	Docstore Link / Attachment: A digital storage location or reference where the scanned copy is kept.
	‚Ä¢	Gap (Days): Displays the number of days between the expected and actual received dates, helping monitor document delays.
	‚Ä¢	Comments: Used to capture reviewer notes, clarifications, or exceptions made during validation.
	‚Ä¢	Validation / Review Flag: Marks whether the document has been checked and approved by the legal or credit control team.

Purpose and Use:

This module ensures that every executed contract has complete and verified documentation, which is essential for regulatory compliance, audit trails, and future dispute handling.

Without all mandatory legal documents being received and validated, the contract cannot move to an executed state.
It helps the bank confirm that the credit exposure is legally enforceable and properly recorded.

In the UI, users can navigate through sections like General, Borrowers, Assets, Covenants, and Summary, each reflecting the document‚Äôs linkage to different parts of the contract.

3. COVENANT MODULE

The Covenant module defines the conditions and obligations that the borrower must meet during the life of the contract. These are part of the agreement between the bank and the borrower to ensure continued financial health and compliance.

Covenants act as post-sanction monitoring tools, helping the bank manage credit risk even after funds are disbursed.

Key Terms and Meanings:
	‚Ä¢	Covenant: A condition or clause within the contract that specifies an obligation for the borrower. For example, ‚ÄúThe borrower must maintain a debt-to-equity ratio below 2.0.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Covenant Type: The main classification ‚Äî Financial, Non-Financial, or Sustainability-linked (SLL KPI).
	‚Ä¢	Financial Covenant: Based on the borrower‚Äôs financial performance, such as profitability ratios or leverage. These are quantitative checks.
	‚Ä¢	Non-Financial Covenant: Relates to operational or behavioral obligations like submitting reports or maintaining insurance.
	‚Ä¢	SLL KPI (Sustainability Linked Loan KPI): Linked to ESG or sustainability goals like reducing emissions or improving social impact.
	‚Ä¢	Monitorable Flag: Indicates if the covenant is actively tracked and reported periodically.
	‚Ä¢	Threshold / Trigger: The limit or condition that determines whether a covenant is in compliance or breached.
	‚Ä¢	Periodicity: Defines how often the covenant is checked ‚Äî for example, quarterly, semi-annual, or yearly.
	‚Ä¢	Due Within (Days): The number of days after the fiscal period within which the borrower must provide compliance information.
	‚Ä¢	Covenant Calendar: An automatically generated schedule that helps track due dates for covenant reporting.
	‚Ä¢	Margin Adjustment: A pricing clause that links covenant performance with interest margin ‚Äî if the borrower performs better, the interest margin may decrease.
	‚Ä¢	Springing Covenant: A conditional covenant that activates only if a particular event occurs, such as a drop in credit rating.
	‚Ä¢	Covenant Status: Shows whether the covenant is Active, Breached, or Waived.

Purpose and Use:

Covenants are a critical part of credit risk management. They protect the bank by ensuring borrowers remain financially stable and transparent throughout the loan period.
If a covenant is breached, it can trigger actions like additional reporting requirements, interest rate adjustments, or even default procedures.

In the UI, the covenant page includes options to create new covenants, select from pre-defined templates, and configure details like type, thresholds, and periodicity. It also has a Covenant Calendar for tracking due dates and a Comment section for additional notes or explanations.

Overall Relationship (End-to-End Link)
	‚Ä¢	A Request is raised by the Relationship Manager to seek credit approval.
	‚Ä¢	Once approved, it becomes a Contract, representing the legally binding agreement between the bank and borrower.
	‚Ä¢	The Legal Document module ensures that all required agreements, guarantees, and security papers are received and validated before the contract is executed.
	‚Ä¢	The Covenant module tracks all ongoing conditions and obligations after the contract is active to ensure continuous compliance.

Together, these three modules ensure the deal lifecycle is legally compliant, risk-monitored, and auditable ‚Äî from approval to post-disbursement monitoring
