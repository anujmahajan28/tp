This video, "JavaScript Functions Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, is 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 54 seconds long. It covers a comprehensive range of JavaScript function topics, from fundamentals to advanced concepts like closures and recursion.
Here's a suggested plan to finish the video in 2 days:
Day 1: Fundamentals and Core Concepts (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch up to the section on Arrow Functions/Nested Functions/Function Scope. This would cover:
   * Introduction and course overview [00:00:00 - 00:03:17]
   * Fundamentals of JavaScript functions [03:17]
   * Clarifying terminologies (functions vs. methods, parameters vs. arguments) [03:30]
   * Function declarations and executions [03:48]
   * Call stack [03:55]
   * Arrow functions [03:55]
   * Nested functions and function scope [03:55]
 * Review and Practice: After watching, take some time to review the concepts and try out the code examples on your own.
Day 2: Advanced Concepts and Application (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch the remainder of the video, starting from Closures. This would cover:
   * Closures [03:59]
   * Callback functions and higher-order functions [03:59]
   * Pure functions [04:03]
   * Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) [04:03]
   * Recursion [04:08]
 * Review and Practice: Again, review the concepts and practice implementing them in your own code.
Stand-up Call Details for the Next 2 Days:
Here's a template for your daily stand-up calls, focusing on your progress with the video:
Day 1 Stand-up (e.g., Friday morning):
 * What I did yesterday (or plan to do today): "Today, I plan to watch the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, focusing on the fundamentals, function declarations, and arrow functions. I'll also spend time practicing the code examples."
 * What I'll do today (if applicable, for a morning stand-up): (Same as above, or if you already started, describe what you've completed.)
 * What I'll do tomorrow (for an evening stand-up): "Tomorrow, I'll continue with the second half of the video, covering closures, callbacks, and recursion, and then dedicate time to practice."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers currently, but I'll reach out if I get stuck on any of the concepts."
Day 2 Stand-up (e.g., Saturday morning):
 * What I did yesterday: "Yesterday, I completed watching the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, covering up to arrow functions and function scope. I also practiced some of the basic function examples."
 * What I'll do today: "Today, I will finish the video by watching the sections on closures, callback functions, pure functions, IIFE, and recursion. My goal is to understand these advanced concepts and then practice implementing them."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers at the moment. I'll focus on understanding the more complex topics today."
Remember to adjust the details based on your actual progress and any challenges you encounter.

Today, I watched the remaining part of the JavaScript video, starting from Closures. It covered closures, callback functions, higher-order functions, pure functions, IIFEs, and recursion. I also continued working on the NRT cases and have almost completed them.
=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(D2), ISNUMBER(E2)), E2 - D2, "")

I‚Äôve started with the basics‚Äîfocusing on core recommended locators like getByRole, getByText, and getByLabel. I‚Äôm also learning how Playwright handles dynamic elements with auto-wait and retry logic. I‚Äôve planned to finish this documentation in 2 days, with hands-on practice to better understand their usage.

üêû Bug Title

[GREENLIGHT] [Auto Approval] Greenlight not auto-approved after reaching auto approval date when Informal

‚∏ª

üìù Description

In a Greenlight request where the Greenlight status is Submitted and marked as Informal, once the configured auto-approval date is reached, the system does not auto-approve the Greenlight as expected. This causes the workflow to remain stuck at the submitted stage.

‚∏ª

üîÅ Steps to Reproduce
	1.	Create a Greenlight Request and fill in required details.
	2.	Ensure the Greenlight status is set to Submitted.
	3.	Set the Greenlight Formal/Informal field to Informal.
	4.	Wait until the auto-approval date is reached.
	5.	Check the status of the Greenlight.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Expected Result

Once the auto-approval date is reached, the Greenlight should automatically transition to Approved, especially for Informal requests.

‚∏ª

‚ùå Actual Result

The Greenlight remains in Submitted status, and does not get auto-approved, even after the auto-approval date is reached.


Also verified if the cases are properly aligned with the test case design rules, and planned updates if any further changes are needed.

Final Presentation Script (Present Tense, with Sanity Testing)

(Start ‚Äì 30‚Äì40 sec)
‚ÄúLet me walk you through my project experience on MyCreditApp ‚Äì the Request Module at BNP Paribas.
This module is used globally to create, structure, and decide on corporate credit requests.
It involves multiple user roles ‚Äî
the Credit Analyst, who creates and structures the request;
the Relationship Manager, who validates compliance;
the Senior Credit Officer or Delegation Holder, who takes the final credit decision;
and the Middle Office (CTM), which updates all approved data in downstream systems like contracts and records.
In short, it‚Äôs the digital workflow for corporate credit approvals.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Testing Strategy ‚Äì ~1 min)
‚ÄúOur main goal in testing this module is to make the process faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain.
Initially, most tests are manual, which makes each release cycle lengthy and repetitive.
So our current testing strategy focuses on five key areas:
	1.	Optimizing manual test cases ‚Äì by removing duplicates and rewriting steps for better clarity.
	2.	Executing Sanity and NRT tests ‚Äì Sanity Testing helps verify that major functions work after every deployment, while NRT or Non-Regression Testing ensures older features still perform correctly after new changes.
	3.	Integrating Playwright automation ‚Äì Playwright is a web automation framework that simulates real user actions on browsers to speed up repetitive testing.
	4.	Streamlining documentation ‚Äì keeping all workflows, test cases, and reports organized and updated.
	5.	Tracking everything via Jira and Excel ‚Äì Jira helps log defects, assign tasks, and track sprint progress, while Excel is used for execution summaries and defect analysis.

The purpose of this strategy is to improve accuracy, reduce testing time, and make our releases more predictable.‚Äù

(Understanding the Requirement ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúMy first contribution was studying how the credit workflow operates end-to-end.
I analyzed how each user role interacts with the system and what business logic lies behind every screen.
This helped ensure that the test scenarios I worked on aligned with the real business flow, not just the UI.
Understanding this context early on helped us identify what truly needed validation during testing.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Test Scenario Design ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúNext came Test Scenario Design.
I helped create modular, well-structured test cases for request creation and approval.
A modular approach means each test focuses on a single function, so it‚Äôs easier to reuse and maintain.
We also worked on optimizing existing cases to remove redundancies.
This directly improved the speed and clarity of our Non-Regression Testing cycles.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Automation Exposure ‚Äì 50 sec)
‚ÄúI also got exposure to Automation using Playwright along with Gherkin syntax.
Gherkin is a language used in Behavior-Driven Development; it describes test scenarios in plain English using the ‚ÄòGiven‚ÄìWhen‚ÄìThen‚Äô format.
For example:
‚ÄòGiven the user is on the Request Dashboard, When they submit details, Then the request is created.‚Äô
Even though I wasn‚Äôt directly coding the scripts, understanding how Playwright executes these Gherkin scenarios gave me a strong foundation for future automation work.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(NRT Execution & Reporting ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúI was also responsible for executing Non-Regression Tests after each release.
We validated that all previously working features still behaved as expected.
Any issues found were logged in Jira, assigned to developers, and tracked until resolution.
Finally, I summarized all execution results, coverage, and defects in Excel reports for our testing dashboard.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Challenges & Solutions ‚Äì 50 sec)
‚ÄúOne of our key challenges was managing a very large set of manual test cases, many of which were outdated or overlapping.
Another was incomplete documentation that made onboarding and reporting slower.
To solve this, I helped reorganize the test repository, updated steps to match the current build, and added proper traceability in Jira.
We also identified which test cases were suitable for future automation using Playwright ‚Äî laying a foundation for faster testing cycles.‚Äù

‚∏ª

(Learnings & Impact ‚Äì 45 sec)
‚ÄúThis project helped me develop a clear understanding of the entire QA lifecycle ‚Äî from requirement analysis and test design to execution and reporting.
I strengthened my skills in SQL for backend validation, Python for scripting logic, and Excel for test analysis.
I also learned how to think critically about test efficiency and business impact rather than just pass/fail results.
Overall, my work helped improve testing accuracy, documentation quality, and readiness for automation in upcoming releases.‚Äù


Impact on the Project:
Through my involvement in the Request module testing, I helped streamline manual test execution and improve the structure of test scenarios, making them more reusable and easier to maintain.
By ensuring consistent sanity and NRT coverage for every release, I contributed to better release stability and early defect detection.
My documentation updates and tracking via Jira and Excel helped bring more transparency to the testing cycle.
Overall, my contribution supported a smoother test process, reduced effort duplication, and strengthened the foundation for future automation integration.
‚∏ª

(Closing ‚Äì 20 sec)
‚ÄúIn summary, my time on the MyCreditApp Request Module gave me hands-on experience in real-world QA processes, exposure to automation tools, and a deeper understanding of how quality assurance drives reliability in financial systems.‚Äù
