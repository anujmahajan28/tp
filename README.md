This video, "JavaScript Functions Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, is 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 54 seconds long. It covers a comprehensive range of JavaScript function topics, from fundamentals to advanced concepts like closures and recursion.
Here's a suggested plan to finish the video in 2 days:
Day 1: Fundamentals and Core Concepts (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch up to the section on Arrow Functions/Nested Functions/Function Scope. This would cover:
   * Introduction and course overview [00:00:00 - 00:03:17]
   * Fundamentals of JavaScript functions [03:17]
   * Clarifying terminologies (functions vs. methods, parameters vs. arguments) [03:30]
   * Function declarations and executions [03:48]
   * Call stack [03:55]
   * Arrow functions [03:55]
   * Nested functions and function scope [03:55]
 * Review and Practice: After watching, take some time to review the concepts and try out the code examples on your own.
Day 2: Advanced Concepts and Application (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch the remainder of the video, starting from Closures. This would cover:
   * Closures [03:59]
   * Callback functions and higher-order functions [03:59]
   * Pure functions [04:03]
   * Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) [04:03]
   * Recursion [04:08]
 * Review and Practice: Again, review the concepts and practice implementing them in your own code.
Stand-up Call Details for the Next 2 Days:
Here's a template for your daily stand-up calls, focusing on your progress with the video:
Day 1 Stand-up (e.g., Friday morning):
 * What I did yesterday (or plan to do today): "Today, I plan to watch the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, focusing on the fundamentals, function declarations, and arrow functions. I'll also spend time practicing the code examples."
 * What I'll do today (if applicable, for a morning stand-up): (Same as above, or if you already started, describe what you've completed.)
 * What I'll do tomorrow (for an evening stand-up): "Tomorrow, I'll continue with the second half of the video, covering closures, callbacks, and recursion, and then dedicate time to practice."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers currently, but I'll reach out if I get stuck on any of the concepts."
Day 2 Stand-up (e.g., Saturday morning):
 * What I did yesterday: "Yesterday, I completed watching the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, covering up to arrow functions and function scope. I also practiced some of the basic function examples."
 * What I'll do today: "Today, I will finish the video by watching the sections on closures, callback functions, pure functions, IIFE, and recursion. My goal is to understand these advanced concepts and then practice implementing them."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers at the moment. I'll focus on understanding the more complex topics today."
Remember to adjust the details based on your actual progress and any challenges you encounter.

Today, I watched the remaining part of the JavaScript video, starting from Closures. It covered closures, callback functions, higher-order functions, pure functions, IIFEs, and recursion. I also continued working on the NRT cases and have almost completed them.

I’ve started with the basics—focusing on core recommended locators like getByRole, getByText, and getByLabel. I’m also learning how Playwright handles dynamic elements with auto-wait and retry logic. I’ve planned to finish this documentation in 2 days, with hands-on practice to better understand their usage.
