This video, "JavaScript Functions Crash Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, is 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 54 seconds long. It covers a comprehensive range of JavaScript function topics, from fundamentals to advanced concepts like closures and recursion.
Here's a suggested plan to finish the video in 2 days:
Day 1: Fundamentals and Core Concepts (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch up to the section on Arrow Functions/Nested Functions/Function Scope. This would cover:
   * Introduction and course overview [00:00:00 - 00:03:17]
   * Fundamentals of JavaScript functions [03:17]
   * Clarifying terminologies (functions vs. methods, parameters vs. arguments) [03:30]
   * Function declarations and executions [03:48]
   * Call stack [03:55]
   * Arrow functions [03:55]
   * Nested functions and function scope [03:55]
 * Review and Practice: After watching, take some time to review the concepts and try out the code examples on your own.
Day 2: Advanced Concepts and Application (Approx. 48 minutes of video)
 * Watch the remainder of the video, starting from Closures. This would cover:
   * Closures [03:59]
   * Callback functions and higher-order functions [03:59]
   * Pure functions [04:03]
   * Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) [04:03]
   * Recursion [04:08]
 * Review and Practice: Again, review the concepts and practice implementing them in your own code.
Stand-up Call Details for the Next 2 Days:
Here's a template for your daily stand-up calls, focusing on your progress with the video:
Day 1 Stand-up (e.g., Friday morning):
 * What I did yesterday (or plan to do today): "Today, I plan to watch the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, focusing on the fundamentals, function declarations, and arrow functions. I'll also spend time practicing the code examples."
 * What I'll do today (if applicable, for a morning stand-up): (Same as above, or if you already started, describe what you've completed.)
 * What I'll do tomorrow (for an evening stand-up): "Tomorrow, I'll continue with the second half of the video, covering closures, callbacks, and recursion, and then dedicate time to practice."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers currently, but I'll reach out if I get stuck on any of the concepts."
Day 2 Stand-up (e.g., Saturday morning):
 * What I did yesterday: "Yesterday, I completed watching the first half of the 'JavaScript Functions Crash Course' video, covering up to arrow functions and function scope. I also practiced some of the basic function examples."
 * What I'll do today: "Today, I will finish the video by watching the sections on closures, callback functions, pure functions, IIFE, and recursion. My goal is to understand these advanced concepts and then practice implementing them."
 * Any blockers: "No blockers at the moment. I'll focus on understanding the more complex topics today."
Remember to adjust the details based on your actual progress and any challenges you encounter.

Today, I watched the remaining part of the JavaScript video, starting from Closures. It covered closures, callback functions, higher-order functions, pure functions, IIFEs, and recursion. I also continued working on the NRT cases and have almost completed them.
=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(D2), ISNUMBER(E2)), E2 - D2, "")

I‚Äôve started with the basics‚Äîfocusing on core recommended locators like getByRole, getByText, and getByLabel. I‚Äôm also learning how Playwright handles dynamic elements with auto-wait and retry logic. I‚Äôve planned to finish this documentation in 2 days, with hands-on practice to better understand their usage.

üêû Bug Title

[GREENLIGHT] [Auto Approval] Greenlight not auto-approved after reaching auto approval date when Informal

‚∏ª

üìù Description

In a Greenlight request where the Greenlight status is Submitted and marked as Informal, once the configured auto-approval date is reached, the system does not auto-approve the Greenlight as expected. This causes the workflow to remain stuck at the submitted stage.

‚∏ª

üîÅ Steps to Reproduce
	1.	Create a Greenlight Request and fill in required details.
	2.	Ensure the Greenlight status is set to Submitted.
	3.	Set the Greenlight Formal/Informal field to Informal.
	4.	Wait until the auto-approval date is reached.
	5.	Check the status of the Greenlight.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Expected Result

Once the auto-approval date is reached, the Greenlight should automatically transition to Approved, especially for Informal requests.

‚∏ª

‚ùå Actual Result

The Greenlight remains in Submitted status, and does not get auto-approved, even after the auto-approval date is reached.


Also verified if the cases are properly aligned with the test case design rules, and planned updates if any further changes are needed.

üîπ Tempo Log Update 1 ‚Äì E2ECC-64072
Time: 4h
Task: Sanity ‚Äì Facilities
Performed high-level sanity for Facility/Sublimit types (New, Renewal, etc.).
Validated field details, error highlights, copy-to-proposed, and summary updates.
Tested duplication, deletion, rearrangement, and submit validations.

‚∏ª

üîπ Tempo Log Update 2 ‚Äì EZECC-61047
Time: 3h
Task: Sanity ‚Äì Compliance
Tested compliance tab visibility based on request type.
Validated section-wise data entry, edit, signature actions, and signing flow.
Checked ‚ÄúBack to Draft‚Äù and conditional field behaviors.


Then I check that creator of request is by default added as stakeholder and their details displayed in the ‚ÄúStakeholder‚Äù fields
