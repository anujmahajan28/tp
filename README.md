Introduce a “Monthly Knowledge Café”—an informal 60-minute virtual or in-person session where team members across the cluster briefly share recent learnings, project highlights, or tools they discovered. This would help new joiners integrate faster, promote cross-team knowledge sharing, and create a collaborative environment. Sessions can include quick tips, Q&A, or even interactive demos.
