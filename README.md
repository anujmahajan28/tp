Bug Title:

Request Status Filter Pushes “Stakeholders” and “Main Originating Site” Fields Down on Dashboard

⸻

✅ Preconditions:
	•	User is logged into My Credit App.
	•	User is on the Request Dashboard page.
	•	Filters panel is expanded.

⸻

🎯 Steps to Reproduce:
	1.	Navigate to the Request Dashboard page.
	2.	Click on the Filters button to open filter options.
	3.	In the Request Status filter section, select all available status options (e.g., Draft, Greenlight Initiated, etc.).
	4.	Observe the layout of the filter fields.

⸻

💥 Actual Result:

The fields like “Stakeholders” and “Main Originating Site” are pushed downwards on the screen, disrupting the UI alignment and making the form look uneven or cluttered.

⸻

✅ Expected Result:

The layout of the filters panel should remain consistent. Selecting multiple options in “Request Status” should not displace other fields like “Stakeholders” or “Main Originating Site”. A scrollable or compact layout should be used instead.
