Subject: Request for Guidance – Intern ISPL Session Marked as “No Show”

Dear [Recipient’s Name/HR Team],

Good morning.

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention that my attendance status for the Intern ISPL session has been marked as “No Show.” I was on leave that day due to university examinations; however, I sincerely apologize for not informing or checking the session schedule in advance.

I kindly request your guidance on whether there is any provision to complete the missed session. Additionally, if a recording of the session is available, I would be grateful if you could share it with me.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if any further information is required from my end.

Warm regards,
Anuj Mahajan
Intern – BNP Paribas ISPL
